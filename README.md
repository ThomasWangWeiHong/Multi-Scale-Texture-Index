# Multi-Scale-Texture-Index
Python implementation of Multi - Scale Texture index

Function is used to generate the multi - scale texture image (with choice of first order or second order texture) as detailed in the 
paper 'Spatial Context - Dependent Multi - Scale and Directional Image Texture' by Timothy A. Warner  & Jong Yeol Lee (2011).

Requirements:
- numpy
- rasterio
- skimage
- tqdm
